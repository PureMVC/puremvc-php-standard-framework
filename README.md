## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) PHP Standard Framework
PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. This is a PHP port of the [AS3 reference implementation of the Standard Version](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-standard-framework/wiki). 

The distribution comes with a built in server-side demo: Zen Garden.
